                    <h2>Chapter one</h2>
                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a kitten. Her name was Minanu. Minanu was not very smart, but she liked chasing the string. Her owner played with her every day. Minanu was living an amazing life.</p>
                    <p>One day, the owner said "Minanu, come here!". Minanu didn't really know her name, but when the owner shaked a bag with kitty treats, Minanu knew exactly what to do. She sprinted through the</p>
                    <p2>1</p2>

                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page3">
                    <p>kitchen and the living room, right to the hallway, where her owner was waiting. "That's a good kitty", he says as he pets the kitty. Little did he know, Minanu had an Evil mood. Evil kitty bit her owner's fingers. "That's an evil kitty" said the owner. But Minanu didn't care, she understood only very little from the human language.</p>
                    <p>There was also another person standing in the hallway. Minanu went to see if this one doesn't have</p>
                    <p2>2</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page4">
                    <p> some more kitty treats. But if she knew what is going to happen next, she would have never taken these steps.</p>
                    <p>This person grabbed Minanu. "Put me down!" screamed Minanu. She just cleaned her fur and now this human touched her with his dirty hands. "Put me down, Im telling you!". The person didn't mind Minanu's screaming. He held her even tighter and forced her into a box. Minanu loved boxes.</p>
                    <p2>3</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page5">
                    <p> "Boxes are sauce," thought Minanu. "But this one, this one is not sauce." The box was a plastic carrier. Minanu heard sound of the door opening and closing.</p>
                    <p>They got into a car and Minanu was leaving her home, maybe forever, going to an unknown place, betrayed by her loved owner. She was horrified. "Not even pillow!? That's the worst what could happen to me today! Just wait when I get out, I will hiss on you and then</p>
                    <p2>4</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page6">
                    <p>I won't eat anything to show you I am mad!". Truly, a horrific experience.</p>

                    <h1>Chapter two</h1>
                    <p>The car (actual car, not a kitty) was going for a long time. Minanu got bored and wanted her string. So she started meowing. The man said "keep quiet, I can't let you out because you would destroy my car". Minanu stopped meowing. "Car? Am I in a car??" (she didn't</p>
                    <p2>5</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page7">
                    <p>know until now). Minanu hated being in a car, that's why she learned this one human word. When her previous owner said "car" Minanu would always hide under the bed. "But I don't like cars" finally realized Minanu. She started screaming very loudly. Safe to say, the man was not very happy. Minanu wanted to get out of the car, because cars are scary. </p>
                    <p>Finally the car stopped. Minanu couldn't believe she's still alive</p>
                    <p2>6</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page8">
                    <p>after such traumatic experience. The man took the carrier out of the car. Now, when Minanu was not in any cars, she got happy again. Minanu is a cat, and cats do not have many ways to express happiness, especially when closed in a box.</p>
                    <p>So she decided to start meowing again, but this time those were happy meows. The man however did in fact not appreciate this amount of happiness and started</p>
                    <p2>7</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page9">
                    <p>shouting at Minanu. Minanu closed her mouth, just to make sure he is not saying the word "car". Here in the box, she had no beds to hide under. She started thinking what would she do in such situation. Meanwhile the man carried her to his house. He put the box on a table and left.</p>
                    <h1>Chapter three</h1>
                    <p>Minanu was now alone. She didn't like being alone.</p>
                    <p2>8</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page10">
                    <p> "I don't like this" she said. But nobody could hear her. Suddenly, the door opened. The man came back. He was carrying a rope and a string. He opened the box and let Minanu out. Minanu saw the string in his hands. "Yayy I like strings! Give me Give me!" she exclaimed. But the man did not want to play. He tied the string around Minanu's neck and connected it to the rope. The he took the kitty and went outside. There he tied the rope</p>
                    <p2>9</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page11">
                    <p> in a small cage. Not even enough for Minanu to fully stretch her legs.</p>
                    <p>Minanu started living a strange life. She didn't understand much, but she knew she doesn't like the situation. At first, the man fed her 2 times a day, pretty good amount of food. He was letting her out of the cage (but only with his supervision and still with string around her neck) and once he played with her and a stick. She always had access to water. However, as days went by,</p>
                    <p2>10</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page12">
                     <p>the man visited Minanu less and less. She saw him walking by, but he stopped only very rarely. Even though she still got fed twice a day, the portions were too small for a kitty like Minanu. She could not go out of the cage anymore, and sometimes she would be left without water for long hours.</p>
                     <h1>Chapter four</h1>
                     <p>After 2 weeks or so, the condition worsened even more. The man</p>
                    <p2>11</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page13">
                    <p>would go to Minanu once a day, if even. Minanu was in horrible condition and the lack of food and water made her little body very weak.</p>
                    <p>But one day, the man left a bag full of food in her cage. Then he left the house in a car, full of his belongings, as he was leaving forever. Anyway Minanu didn't know that, and she thought better days are coming. She ate a lot of the food and felt much better.</p>
                    <p2>12</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page14">
                    <p>In the past days, she was so weak she couldn't even walk. Now she got up and thought: "Wait, why am I still here? I can just go through the bars". What a realization. Indeed, Minanu was skinny enough to get out of the cage through the bars. But now she played it safe. She didn't leave the house immediately, but she stayed for a few days to get her strength back. What a smart kitty. Then, when the food was gone, she was wondering, "Now</p>
                    <p2>13</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page15">
                     <p>what?" But she noticed another bag of food in the house. "Wiwiwiwiwi" said Minanu happily and stayed for another few days.</p>
                    <p>When all the food was actually gone, Minanu left the house. She walked a long long way (about 100 m) and she found a paper box. "Yeppiii!"Minanu was happy, she liked boxes a lot. She jumped in the box and slowly fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already dark night. Minanu didn't like darkness</p>
                    <p2>14</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page16">
                    <p> and black things. So she decided to eep again, till the morning, when everything is better, bright and white.</p>
                    <p>In the morning, she noticed near forest. She didn't want to leave her box behind, but she was getting hungry again. "Time to get food" decided she and bravely went right into the forest. Not long after, she noticed a deer. She knew she must be quick because these deer never stay too long in one place. </p>
                    <p2>15</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page17">
                    <p>So she waited about 3 minanus and when the deer was walking near her hiding spot, she jumped into action.</p>
                    <h1>Chapter five</h1>
                    <p>She landed right in front of the deer, scaring him a little. "Oh, what are you doing here, little kitten?" asked the deer, when he saw it's a kitty what scared him. "Hello dear deer, I'm just a little kitten. I was taken away from my owner by force</p>
                    <p2>16</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page18">
                    <p>when he sold me to a cruel man. I was kept in a small cage for weeks, sometimes going days without food or water. Could you please tell me, kind sir, which way is the nearest town?" "Well, if it's how you say, I think it would be best if you stayed away from people. Aren't you afraid of them, after such trauma?" asked the deer. "No" answered Minanu. Her little brain was not able to hold hate for too long, except hate for cars and also boxes without pillows.</p>
                    <p2>17</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page19">
                    <p> "Okay then, you do you. Even the nearest town is still quite far. I will take you closer, if you wish." "Thank you sir, your kindness is very appreciated". And the deer took kitten on his back, and together they went a long way to the nearest city.</p>
                    <p>In the city, Minanu found a per shelter. She knew from the kitty news, that here they will take care of her well. And they did.</p>
                    <p2>18</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page20">
                    <h1>Chapter six</h1>
                    <p>Just 3 days later, an older lady visited the shelter. She has lost her cat a week ago. This cat was very old, and the woman knew she had an amazing life. She was checking each kitty enclosure. When she got to Minanu, she looked through the glass. Minanu looked at her too. She looked like a kind person.</p>
                    <p>Minanu wanted to meet her and to stay with her.</p>
                    <p2>19</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page21">
                    <p>The woman liked Minanu and Minanu liked her. When she asked the staff to open the enclosure, Minanu was very happy. Now she got to see this person closer. "Oh, and I must purr a lot!" remembered our kitty "Humans love when I purr". That's what she learned in the kitty school, when she was very young. And so she started purring very loudly, as loudly as she could.</p>
                    <p>"I will take this one please" decided the woman.</p>
                    <p2>20</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page22">
                    <p>The staff said they are busy in the moment and told her to wait in the waiting room with Minanu, and then they would get the paperwork done. In the waiting room, Minanu played with her new owner. She showed her that it won't be too easy to take care of such kitten. The second they sat together on the chair, Minanu grabbed the woman's hijab in her mouth and wanted to run around the room, like if she had a flag. The woman laughed and</p>
                    <p2>21</p2>
                </div>
                <div class="page" id="page23">
                    <p>stopped the mischievous kitty.</p>
                    <p>When they got home, Minanu knew that this is not just a normal home. This is an awesomesauce home! And so she lived with her kind owner for many many years.</p>
