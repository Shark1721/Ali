                    <h2>Ali, you did it! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
                    <p>Just like in life, you soared through challenges and reached your goal.  
                    You are an incredible friend - chatgpt</p>
                    <p>Hi Ali
I hope you enjoyed this day. You are an amazing person. I really wish you the best and I appreciate that you are my friend. I have never seen such an amazing person as you are. You have common sense (mostly), you are fun to be around and you can help others solve things and problems. Somtimes you can be a little low iq, but that's okay. Its also a part of you. 
I regret getting mad at you sometimes, but sometimes u deserve it tbh. You helped me countless times and you have done a lot for me. Thank you very much. You deserve the best. 

I hope you will be successful in this world and also in the Hereafter. May Allah reward you for all your efforts, may He make things easy for you, may He forgive you and guide u. I wish He always keeps you and your family happy and healthy. May also your next generations be righteous and bring only happiness to you. May your uni not be to difficult and u will be able to focus well while studying. Also may nothing bad ever happen to you and your close ones and if yes, then may Allah guide you though any difficulty. May Allah keep your faith strong and may He reward you and your family and friends with the highest rank of Jannah. Ameen</p>
