                    <hr>
                    <p>A Minanu is something that is very cute, adorable and usually very little. You can easily recognize a Minanu, by your own natural reaction. When coming across a Minanu, you will probably tend to say "mnmnmnmnnmnmn". Another (less yet still quite common) reaction is "Awhshshshshsh".</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><b>Examples of a Minanu: </b>A kitty, a doggy, a small mouse (commonly small animals)</p>
                    <p><b>Use in sentence: </b> "Ali come look at this kitty!" Ali: "Mnmnmnmnmnmnm. That one must be A Minanu!"</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>A Wiwiwi is very similar to a Minanu. Wiwiwis tend to be bigger in size, but still very adorable. Another difference is in the natural reaction. When seeing a Wiwiwi, you might feel the need to say "Wiwiwiiweiiwiwi". "Awhshshsh" is a reaction common for both, wiwiwis and minanus.</p>
                    <p>However a Wiwiwi and a Minanu can be used for any cute-looking creature. The choice depends on many other factors and both are suitable for most situations and creatures.</p>
